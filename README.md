# PC-Gameshark-Dongle
Everything necessary to produce the security dongle for the Win 95/98 PC Gameshark and Action Replay software. Details on the functionality of the PIC12C508A can be found [here.](https://github.com/parasyte/picard) Though that page discusses the PS1 Gameshark Pro 12C508A, the code used on both PICs is nearly identical. There are small differences not tied to operation. This wouldn't have been possible without @Parasyte who bravely subjected his PC Gameshark Dongle to science in order for this to exist, and who meticulously reverse engineered the function of the PIC12C508A available at the above link.

PCB Thickness: 1.2 mm
