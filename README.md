# PC-Gameshark-Dongle
Everything necessary to produce the security dongle for the Win 95/98 PC Gameshark and Action Replay software. Details on the functionality of the PIC12C508A can be found [here.](https://github.com/parasyte/picard) Though that page discusses the PS1 Gameshark Pro 12C508A, the code used on both PICs is nearly identical. There are small differences not tied to operation.
